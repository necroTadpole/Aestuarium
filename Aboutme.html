        Hi! I'm Tadd. I'm an aspiring environmental scientist with a fascination in aquatic ecosystems and a special interest in drinkmaking :)

        I'm messily teaching myself html because I have began to resent the existance of social media as it stands today. Its awful. I didn't ask to be subjected to the hatred and debates spurred on by people who do not know me. The only thing that relates us  is algorithms with no soul. It's a festering pile of shit that aims to drum up as much money as possible before theres no further they can grow. I hope that it all goes away. I hope they cave under their own greed and we end up with nothing but our own two hands to build the internet back up. Until then, I can take solace in this small space.

        I'm nonbinary, I like Kimya Dawson and trashy grungy folksy punk music. I like games but don't quite like gaming as much as I wish I did. I work at a gas station while I fight to get my bachelors degree because there's no science field work without formal education that costs a lot of money.
    </P>

        I'll make this prettier later. for now I just want to make sure none of my links lead u to a 404 anymore and get the basics down :P
