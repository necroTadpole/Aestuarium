    <P>
        Become part of your local music scene!! You do not have to create the music, but go out of your house! listen to it! No money necessary. We need to become better parts of our communities, and I know if you find yourself on my website of all places, you probably know that already. but this is a call to action!! Local music is wonderful, thrilling, and I have had some of the best experiences ever through it. Punk music always feels better when you have other punks to bash your head into. Orchestral music always sounds better when you have someone to appreciate it with. Whether or not those people came free with your fucking xbox or not doesn't matter! Just like cool mushrooms, if you want to have friends you gotta find them yourself.

        If you are going to listen to music, you must find HOW you wish to listen to music first. If you're using spotify currently, I urge you to stop. Ill tell you why eventually, need to dedicate it's own page to that. now look at your bank account. can you afford to pay for an apple music subscription? Certainly you don't want the headache that is staring at the amazon logo anytime you want to listen to music either. so then what?

    <h6> Fun fact! A dead zone is a low oxygen environment found in some of the oceans and lakes in the world. When a dead zone falls under a certain oxygen level, both the flora and fauna in the aquatic environment begin to die off en masse. As of 1970, the amount of dead zones especially on popular coastlines have been increasing.
