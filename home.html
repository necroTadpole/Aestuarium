    <h3>
        not the best place to drown your sorrows

    <p>
        Hello! In a fit of stagnation and frustration with being stuck in one place, I am giving myself another chance.
    </p>
    <p>
        So welcome to the pond. Make yourself comfortable, dive as deep as you wish, or as deep as your oxygen supply will allow you.
    </p>

            About me
        </H4>
        I am TADPOLE. (They/Them). I am an agender person(?) living(?) probably. 
        <br> 
        I love a lot of different things, and want a place to talk about them comfortably.
        <br> 
        and by comfortably I mean in a place that is mostly free from AI, mostly free from Assholes, and mostly free from corporate greed.  I quite like coffee and tea, and reading. Recently I have been reading a book titled "Urban homesteading" but by the time this is read by you, it's likely I have since moved on. I don't have a lot that defines me right now, I feel like a muddled soup that hasn't been quite reduced, but I'll add more whenever I think of more.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe every person should have a personal website and an mp3 player of their choosing. The world might be a slightly better place.
