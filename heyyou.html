    Shit is fucking bad. But it's been bad before and we are a hearty people who have survived everything by taking care of each other. by being creative and clever, using magic and trickery and grit. This is either insignificant or impossible when we are alone, so if all else fails, we must find and hold on to each other. We [must] create this in each other.

    You are a gift, a muse, and a weapon. We are lucky to have you with us. You have to live because I love you too much. And you have to really put your fucking cunt into it too because it would be such a waste. Please. go insane. Attack this fucking world with a hammer so I can hear the sound. Transition. It's worth it. Even if you don't end up where you think.  Prove your childhood bullies and your dad correct, you ARE a faggot. Spit it out. Become something that would make them gough their eyes out.Become something that would surprise me. Become something else.
