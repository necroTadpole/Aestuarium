					I'm happy about how this is turning out. I have been severely struggling with formatting this damned website. Every other aspect of customization feels very intuitive, but instead of being able to wrap my head around how it works I have just resulted to just using margins and small pixel movements to change the positions of the boxes.

					Aside from the website troubles I am quite happy with how it's coming together. I hope to have the patience to add a couple more pages if I find the time. I am currently focused on studying but this is a fun project to work on on the side. I think a solid 'about me' is in order coming up next. Until then I might try to throw in a guest book. Other Ideas I have had is trying to make the text boxes look like lilly pads on a lake. Have them move with water effects when scrolling or some shit. I think a longer website with scattered text boxes full of fun stuff would be a nice way to format this project that shows more who I am creatively as a person. I am winding. I am free and flowing and ever changing. I am always evolving and learning.
