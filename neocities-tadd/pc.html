    <h3>This is still totally a work in progress, but I might as well give you something to read in the meantime!!</h3>

        ok so the games I plan on fully writing reviews for first are Coffee Talk and Ace attourney. These two games own my heart entirely god I love them so much. I am still playing through Ace attourney but there will be a couple of uncomprehensive reviews on certain games if I am unable to bring myself to play through them haha

        Coffee talk- FUCKING FANTASTIC. Beautiful stunning game. Pixel art to die for. The ideal playstyle I found was playing it one day at a time, right before your morning coffee or tea. If you are a barista at heart the way I am, You will die for this glorified visual novel. The game aspect is small. You must make drinks for your customers and listen to them. thats your only job. In the second game it gets a little more complicated but still has the same wonderful storytelling aspect at its core.
        9/10. not for everyone, replay it once, trust me.
